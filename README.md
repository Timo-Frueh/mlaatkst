# MLA at KST

This Application was specifically designed to help students of the KST get their citations right. The student can input all attributes of the work they want to cite into the entry fields and the program spits out the correct citation which can be copied at this point.
The program is in German in the moment, but I'll try to add a possibility to change the language to English, too.

## Installation

For installation from source use the installation script (pyinstaller needs to be installed for this). The bundle needs to be dragged out of the dist folder to the application folder after the install.
Alternatively you can download the .dmg directly from the last release.

NOTE: I do not have any developer certificate, so MacOS won't open the program if it is not built from source. But if you trust me, you can run:

``` Shell
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/MLAatKST.app
```

This should resolve the issue. I might do something about that in the future, if I get to do it for free, otherwise you'll just have to go with that.
